        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, 
            garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine 
            soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to 
            overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
