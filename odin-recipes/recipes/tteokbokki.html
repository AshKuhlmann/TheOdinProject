        <li>Korean fish cakes</li>
        <li>Korean soup stock</li>
        <li>Onion</li>

        <li>Roasted sesame seeds</li>

        <li>Stalk green onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Soak the rice cakes in warm water for 10 minutes. 
            (If you are using fresh rice cakes that are already tender, 
            feel free to skip this step. However, if you are using 
            packaged rice cakes from the fridge, it is recommended 
            to soak them to enhance their moisture level before 
            proceeding with the recipe.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high 
            heat and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it 
            with a spatula. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, 
            add the rice cakes, fish cakes and onion. Boil them 
            a further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully 
            cooked.  Then, to thicken the sauce and to deepen 
            the flavor, simmer it over low heat for a further 2 to 4 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly 
            stir. Serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
